# coins-detection
This project will try to detect every type of euro coin within an image using just Computer Vision techniques (avoiding ML or DL just for didactic purposes).

## Overview
We will try to detect the amount of money within a euro coins image like this one:

![Example of initial image](images/coins.jpg)

Each image should be from above and the coins could be facing either heads or tails but they should not be overlapping each other.

## Methodology
We are going to go through preprocess steps to achieve a better image to detect. We will use the size and color of the coins to classify them:

### Size classification
First we will start by binarizing the image:


## MATLAB dependencies
- Image Processing Toolbox
